## About the project
**Proffy is a online study platform.** <br>
In the time that we live now with social distance and quarantine, 
schools and colleges had to stop. Proffy became a way out of this situation. 
With the site, teachers can continue passing knowledge and students can continue learning. <br>

**How this work?** <br>
- **Give classes**: The teacher can present their available time, subject to teach, and the value per class/hour.
- **To study**:  The student can look for the best day, time and subject to study.
